            E-commerce refers to the online buying and selling of goods and services. It has transformed the traditional shopping process, allowing people to purchase necessary items from anywhere in the world at any time. E-commerce platforms offer a wide range of products, from clothing and electronics to food and digital services. Thanks to secure payment systems and efficient delivery networks, online shopping has become more convenient and accessible today.

            E-commerce helps businesses and consumers reduce costs, expand markets, and provide a personalized shopping experience. Businesses can analyze customer behavior, offer relevant products, and ensure an easy shopping process. Consumers, in turn, can compare prices, read reviews, and receive orders directly at their doorsteps. With the advancement of technology (such as AI-driven recommendations and mobile-optimized designs), e-commerce continues to grow, shaping the future of retail.
